# Coopswipe [WIP]
Cooperation with open partnership app 


### Description of the project

The proposal is to create an app to provide each establishment with recommendations to customers of other establishments in the neighborhood.
The idea is to create a marketplace-enabled platform, where the businesses can find each other. That means that the app users are businesses.
