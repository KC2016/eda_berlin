# Coopswipe [WIP]
Cooperation with open partnership app


### Description of the project

The proposal is to create an app to provide each establishment with recommendations to customers of other establishments in the neighborhood.
The idea is to create a marketplace-enabled platform, where the businesses can find each other. That means that the app users are businesses.

## My cooperation
1. Analysis of establishments per neighborhood:

  The criticism is that the businesses will not find enough businesses around themselves. So the essence of your understanding is correct, just the framing is different.
  > *The idea is to count the number of establishments by category in each city area. We will deduct the possible number of partnerships from that later, because at this point we don’t know what a “successful partnership” could mean.*
